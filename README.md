### How do I get set up? ###

* Install the .qplug file to Documents -> Q-Sys Designer -> QSC -> Plugins

### Q-SYS setup ###

* In the plugin properties, set the number of required Area Slots. Each Area Slot will generate a new page that allows configuration of 1 area.
* Set a area number for each slot.
* Set the number of Presets.
* If Logical Channel control is required, set 'Enable Logical Channels' to 'Yes'. Set the number of Logical Channels.
* Polling is not always required; it Polling is required, set 'Enable Polling' to 'Yes' and set a Poll Rate. Polling may be required if the Presets and Channels will be updated from other control methods simultaneously.
* 'Logical Channel' faders can either be used in real-time, or snapshotted in Q-SYS to achieve 'preset' functionality. It is recommended to use Dyanlite Presets instead, however the Logical Channels have been tested to work with snapshots.
